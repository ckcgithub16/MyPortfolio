                                <p>
									This project served as the capstone for my Robotics and Intelligent Systems course, where four classmates and I programmed 
									an RC truck using Python and ROS (Robot Operating System) to complete two challenging autonomous navigation tasks.<br /><br />
									
									<b>Task 1</b> - Obstacle Course Racing: Inspired by Ken Block's Ultimate Gymkhana Grid, we implemented ILQR (Iterative Linear 
									Quadratic Regulator) with cost-prioritization to navigate the truck autonomously through a complex waypoint sequence 
									while avoiding up to 20 randomly placed obstacle cubes. The course required precise navigation through 16 waypoints in 
									a specific order within a 3 minute 30 second time limit.<br /><br />

									Teams received time penalties for various infractions during their runs. Head-on collisions with obstacles resulted in 
									a 5-second penalty each, while obstacle brushing added 3 seconds per incident. Manual overrides of the autonomous system 
									incurred a 5-second penalty, and track departures where the truck crossed lane boundaries added 3 seconds each.<br /><br />

									Our team was the <b>4th fastest out of 14 teams</b> after accounting for time reductions due to penalties.<br /><br />

									<b>Task 2</b> - Safety Filter: We developed an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that continuously monitored manual driver 
									inputs and intervened to prevent unsafe actions. The safety filter successfully prevented dangerous user inputs by overriding 
									steering inputs that would drive the truck off-track or too far across lane boundaries, while minimizing unnecessary interventions 
									to maintain smooth operation.<br />

								<h2>Implementation & Technical Approach</h2>
								<p>For Task 1, our obstacle avoidance algorithm operated by examining each point along our planned path, detecting nearby 
								obstacles, and dynamically switching lanes when obstacles came within a threshold distance. We applied a Gaussian filter 
								(σ = 2 for the physical truck, σ = 5 for simulation) to smooth the path transitions and prevent abrupt directional changes that 
								could destabilize the vehicle.<br /><br />

								For Task 2, we implemented a two-layer safety system using dual planners - one evaluating user control inputs and another running 
								ILQR for safe trajectory generation. The system calculated trajectory costs over varying time horizons, allowing maximum user 
								control until the last safe moment before ILQR intervention was required.</p>

								<h2>Key Lessons Learned</h2>
								<p>The most significant challenge was bridging the simulation-to-hardware gap. Algorithms that performed flawlessly in RViz simulation 
								required substantial parameter adjustments for the physical truck. We discovered that hardware variations emerged over extended testing 
								sessions, even without code changes, highlighting the importance of robust, adaptive control systems.<br /><br />
								Systematic debugging proved crucial, particularly when transitioning between simulation and hardware environments. A single misplaced 
								boolean flag in our Task 2 implementation initially prevented user controls from properly functioning on the physical truck, emphasizing 
								the critical importance of methodical code review and comprehensive testing across all operational modes.
								The project demonstrated advanced robotics concepts including real-time path planning, obstacle avoidance, and safety-critical control 
								systems in both simulation and physical environments.</p>
